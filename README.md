# Backward-Reachability-Analysis-and-Control-Synthesis
This code is to accompany the paper: [Backward reachability for polynomial systems on a finite horizon](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.03225.pdf)

## Getting started
All the code is written in MATLAB.

### Prerequisites
There are three packages required:
* [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/)
* [SOSOPT](https://dept.aem.umn.edu/~AerospaceControl/)
* [Multipoly](https://dept.aem.umn.edu/~AerospaceControl/)
